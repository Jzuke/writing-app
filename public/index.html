The purpose of this app is to be a catalyst for creative juices to begin flowing for any sort of creative writing. The methodology was taken by Pat Pattison in [Songwriting without Boundaries](www.google.com), and the idea is simple.

There will be an object based prompt. You will spend either 10 minutes, 5 minutes, or 90 seconds writing about that prompt. You will only use your five (actually seven) senses. The five you are familiar with—See, Hear, Touch, Smell, Taste—and two you may be less familiar with:

Theoretically you will do this exercise every day, ideally doing one prompt for each time length, but at the very least one of the time lengths. It is to help build a habit out of your writing by doing it every day. The time constraints are integral to habit building. It is nearly impossible :link?: to build habits if you don't have a set of boundaries around what you're trying to accomplish. Let's say you spend 3 hours one day writing about a specific object because it comes naturally and it's something that excites you. The next day if you start to write and the prompt isn't something as exciting or familiar, you may have a hard time mustering up the motivation to write anything—thinking you might not think you have the endurance for another 3 hours, since in your head that is now a standard.

With that in mind, this exercise is not intended to create masterpieces, or even coherent statements—it is meant to be scrappy and for you to practice diving into your senses. After spending time doing this every day, when you spend time with your more focused writing, whatever that may be, you will be well equipped to draw upon your senses to help enhance whatever the piece may be.

<span style="font-size:2em;"><bold>HOW IT WORKS:</bold></span> 

1) Generate a new prompt with the 'New Prompt' button until you find one that you find suitable.

2) Enable 'Fullscreen mode' if you want your writing to be distraction free.

3) Choose the length of time you want from the dropdown.

4) Click the 'Start Writing' button to open the text editor and to begin the exercise. There will be a timer that indicates where you are, it will turn red the last 10 seconds. As soon as the timer is up the exercise will end and it will cut you off immediately. This is intentional, this is the point of the app so you can't just keep typing for 3 hours.

5) The editor will automatically exit and your stored entry will be visible on the left, if you want to revisit it, click on the entry to have it displayed on the right. You will have the option to save it to your computer if you think it is something you want to 

<span style="font-size:2em;"><bold>DISCLAIMER:</bold></span>

The entries are stored locally in your browser and there is no guarantee they will be there forever. If you find you wrote something particularly meaningful, I would highly suggest either writing it down outside of this app or saving the file itself.

Otherwise this is an exercise in ephemerality and there need not be any focus on the content of the
